## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Note, you'll need to have MiKTeX or some other LaTeX distribution installed if you want to generate PDFs. You'll also need Pandoc, but this comes included if you're using Rstudio.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can also use `rmarkdown::render` for markdown files. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
kable(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Not just R

We can also use other languages using other engines, like `engine = bash`:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
if(Sys.which("bash") == ""){
  message("Bash is not available on this machine")
}
```

```{r bash-engine, engine='bash', eval = !Sys.which("bash") == ""}
echo `ls`
```

Only catch is that R is the only language which has objects persist between code chunks

## Reading in chunks

You may not want to have to start your document from scratch. You can read chunks from other documents by marking them up with comments:

```{r read-chunks}
read_chunk("child_document.R")
x <- 5
```

```{r child-chunk, comment = "child>"}
```

## Freedom from paper (only for HTML)

```{r, include = is_html, eval = is_html}
library(DT)
datatable(cars, options = list(pageLength = 5))
```


```{r, include = is_html, eval = is_html}
library(leaflet)

#Annual temperature in Oregon
orstationc <- read.csv("http://geog.uoregon.edu/bartlein/old_courses/geog414s05/data/orstationc.csv")

pal <- colorQuantile("YlOrRd", NULL, n = 8)
leaflet(orstationc) %>% 
  addTiles(urlTemplate = "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(color = ~pal(tann))
```
