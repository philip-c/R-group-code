I've attached several files to this email; here's a short description of each one:
- co2_emissions_script.R: This is the script I showed you all today.  R code files end with the ".R" extension.
- italyData.csv: One of the datasets I used in the R script (I didn't attach the other because it's much larger).
- plot_1.png, plot_2.png: Two of the 10 graphs generated by the script
- co2_emissions.Rmd: I didn't get to this today, but you can use "R Markdown" to create pdf, html, or Word documents with embedded code and images.  This file is the markdown file and can be easily processed to generate the other documents.
- co2_emissions.docx/.html/.pdf: The documents generated from the .Rmd file.  This is the same code we went through today, but in a document format.
